## Description

Budgeting App is a personal finance management application that helps users track their income, expenses, and organize their finances. The project is currently in development, but basic features are already implemented.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Budgets with Flexible Time Periods:** Set up budgets for specific time framesâ€”whether monthly, weekly, daily, or custom durations like one-time travel budgets.
- **Focused Budget Tracking:** Assign transactions to individual budgets for better control over specific expense categories.
- **Spending Limits for Categories:** Set spending limits for categories within each budget to promote disciplined financial habits.
- **Budget History Analysis:** Review your previous budgets to assess spending patterns and track financial progress.
- **Goal Setting:** Create and monitor saving or spending goals. Allocate transactions toward achieving specific targets or purchases.
- **Diverse Transaction Types:** Classify transactions into categories like upcoming payments, subscriptions, recurring expenses, debts (borrowed), and credits (lent). Each type functions intuitivelyâ€”e.g., settle upcoming payments or mark lent funds as collected.
- **Custom Categories:** Build custom transaction categories suited to your financial habits. Choose icons and set default behavior (expense or income) for quick data entry.
- **Smart Titles:** Automatically link repeated transaction names to pre-assigned categories for consistent tracking.
- **Powerful Search and Filters:** Quickly locate transactions using filters by date, category, amount, or tags for instant access to details.
- **Batch Editing with Ease:** Edit or delete multiple transactions effortlessly with gestures like long-pressing and swiping.

## Future Plans

- Advanced financial analysis and detailed reports.
- Graphs and visualizations to represent your data visually.
- Notifications and reminders for upcoming payments.
- Mobile apps for iOS and Android for budgeting on the go.
